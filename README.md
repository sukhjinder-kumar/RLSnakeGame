## Get Started

This is a repository for a snake game, where the game can be played by a human or an AI bot trained using Reinforcement Learning. To get started first setup the environment. This is tested on python 3.9.6. To install the packages in a fresh environment you can use - `python3 -m venv <Environment path>`, the Environment path is nothing but the path of folder in which to install the packages. To activate, `source <Environmant Path>/bin/activate` and use `deactivate` command to revert back to base python packages. Now to install libraries do `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

To start the game run the `main.py` file.

## RoadMap

- Create a snake game s.t the state, rewards are structured in a way most apt for RL agents

- Create a basic AI agent

- Create a AI agent that improves in real time using RL. Also show progress metrics like running score history, averages, etc. Present it a visual format using graphs.

- Deploy the app on some server (streamlit?), so that it easy to showcase.
